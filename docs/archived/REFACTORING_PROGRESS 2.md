# Refactoring Progress Report

## ✅ Completed Files

### Configuration & Infrastructure
1. ✅ `backend/app/config.py` - All configuration constants, env vars, tier configs
2. ✅ `backend/app/extensions.py` - Flask extensions, CORS, Firebase initialization

### Services
3. ✅ `backend/app/services/auth.py` - Authentication decorator and credit check
4. ✅ `backend/app/services/firebase.py` - Firebase initialization (updated)
5. ✅ `backend/app/services/gmail_client.py` - Gmail OAuth and API operations
6. ✅ `backend/app/services/openai_client.py` - OpenAI client initialization

## 🔄 In Progress

### Services (Still Need to Create)
- `services/pdl_client.py` - PDL API client (search, enrichment, caching)
- `services/reply_generation.py` - Email generation functions
- `services/directory_search.py` - Directory search logic
- `services/resume_parser.py` - Resume parsing and PDF extraction
- `services/pdf_builder.py` - PDF generation for meeting preps
- `services/stripe_client.py` - Stripe webhook handlers

### Routes (Need to Create/Update)
- `routes/health.py` - Already exists, needs verification
- `routes/spa.py` - Already exists, needs verification
- `routes/gmail_oauth.py` - Gmail OAuth routes
- `routes/emails.py` - Email generation routes
- `routes/contacts.py` - Contact CRUD routes
- `routes/directory.py` - Directory routes
- `routes/runs.py` - Free/Pro tier run endpoints
- `routes/enrichment.py` - Autocomplete and enrichment
- `routes/resume.py` - Resume parsing routes
- `routes/meeting_prep.py` - Meeting prep routes
- `routes/billing.py` - Stripe and tier management
- `routes/users.py` - User management routes

### Utils (Need to Create)
- `utils/contact.py` - Contact utilities and helpers
- `utils/users.py` - User utilities
- `utils/meeting_prep.py` - Meeting utilities
- `utils/enums.py` - Enum utilities (if any)

### Models (Need to Create/Update)
- `models/contact.py` - Contact normalization
- `models/users.py` - User models (if any)
- `models/enums.py` - Enums (if any)

### Core Files
- `backend/wsgi.py` - Flask app factory and blueprint registration
- `app.py` - Temporary shim (delegates to backend.wsgi)

## 📊 Statistics
- Total lines in app.py: ~7813
- Routes to extract: ~41
- Service functions: ~100+
- Utility functions: ~50+

## 🎯 Next Steps
1. Continue creating service files (PDL, reply generation, etc.)
2. Create route blueprints systematically
3. Move utility functions to utils/
4. Create wsgi.py with app factory
5. Create app.py shim
6. Update all imports to use absolute `app.*` paths
7. Test and verify route parity

## 📝 Notes
- All function signatures must remain identical
- Import paths will use absolute `app.*` format
- Circular imports will be resolved by moving imports into function scope when needed
- Runtime behavior must be 100% identical
