"""Scout PAGE_REGISTRY: the single source of truth for every page Scout can
navigate a user to.

The registry drives three things:
  1. The "pages you can navigate to" section of Scout's system prompt
     (build_pages_prompt_section), so the prompt and the navigable route set
     can never drift apart.
  2. navigate tool-call validation (valid_routes, get_page).
  3. The approve-flow rules (required_inputs, credit_cost, tier_required).

Route strings match the LIVE frontend route table (connect-grow-hire/src/
App.tsx). The Find tabs are distinct entries keyed by their full
query-string route ("/find?tab=companies") because they are different
products with different prefill fields; get_page resolves an exact match
before falling back to the bare path.

Fields per entry:
  route            Path Scout navigates to.
  purpose          What the page does. Terse and factual.
  inputs           Form field names Scout may prefill. These must match the
                   frontend form fields AND the scout_prefill sessionStorage
                   bridge. Empty when the page has no Scout-prefillable form.
  required_inputs  Subset of inputs that must be present to navigate. Empty for
                   every page today: landing on a page never hard-requires a
                   field, the page accepts partial prefill. Kept as the hook
                   the clarify rule reads.
  send_user_here_when  Natural-language trigger for the model.
  credit_cost      Credits the page's own action charges (per result/use), or
                   None when the page has no credit-spending action. Scout
                   never spends credits; this tells the approve flow whether a
                   credit-spending action is implied. Numbers mirror
                   backend/app/config.py CREDIT_COSTS.
  tier_required    Minimum tier to use the page ("pro"/"elite"), or None for
                   all tiers.

# Registry version - bump on ANY change to PAGE_REGISTRY or ROUTE_ALIASES.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The Scout embedding caches (Phase 4 Tier B) stamp every entry with the
# version it was built against. A lookup ignores entries from an older
# version, and stale entries are evicted on the next write cycle. Bumping this
# is how a registry change invalidates the caches without a manual flush.
# v4: discover_companies executes multi-company discovery in chat; cached
# navigate answers for those phrasings must not serve.
# v5: /my-network/managers added; hiring-manager tracker aliases moved off
# the search tab.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Route aliases - hand-curated phrasings the pre-LLM router (Tier A) maps to a
# route. Kept next to PAGE_REGISTRY so the two never drift. Keys are lowercase
# phrases. The router only treats an alias as a hit behind an explicit
# navigation verb ("open ...", "go to ...", "take me to ..."), so a passing
# mention of a word like "jobs" inside a sentence does not trigger navigation.
# Every value must be a route present in PAGE_REGISTRY (asserted at import).
