"""Scout tool schema: the three tools the model must pick exactly one of, every
turn.

Phase 2 of the Scout consolidation. This replaces the old "respond with valid
JSON in this exact format" prose contract. The model now answers by calling one
tool, and the tool's input schema enforces the structure, so the response can
never be missing a field or malformed.

The three tools map one to one onto what Scout can do on a turn:
  navigate  - propose taking the user somewhere (a plan, not an action).
  answer    - reply in chat, no navigation.
  clarify   - ask one short follow-up question.

Definitions are in Anthropic tool-use format. to_openai_tools() converts them
for the OpenAI fallback path (and for local testing without an Anthropic key).
