"""
Greenhouse form-filler.

Hits the application form via Browserless-hosted Chromium. Verified against
the captured SpaceX fixture at backend/tests/fixtures/auto_apply/greenhouse_sample.html.

Field model (from the SpaceX fixture — Greenhouse forms are consistent):
  Standard text         : id="first_name" / "last_name" / "preferred_name"
                          id="email" / "phone" / "start-year--0" / "end-year--0"
  File uploads          : id="resume" / "cover_letter" (type=file, visually-hidden)
  Combobox (react-select): id="country" / "candidate-location" /
                            id="school--0" / "degree--0" / "discipline--0" /
                            id="gender" / "hispanic_ethnicity" /
                            id="veteran_status" / "disability_status"
  Custom questions      : id="question_XXXXXXXXX" with label[for=...]
                          label IDs end in "-label"

EEO option mapping is conservative — Greenhouse exposes "Decline to identify"
(or similar wording) as a stable option on the gender / race / veteran /
disability dropdowns. The Application Profile defaults sensitive fields to
"decline" which we translate to that option here.

Dry-run mode fills everything but does not click the Submit button. We always
return a full-page screenshot so the user can verify visually in the modal.

    The challenge: many companies (Stripe, Databricks, DoorDash, …)
    configure their Greenhouse boards so that visits to the canonical
    `boards.greenhouse.io/{slug}/jobs/{id}` URL get redirected to their own
    custom careers page (stripe.com/jobs/listing/...). The form is on a
    different URL.

    The two patterns that reliably reach the form regardless of custom-URL
    redirects:

      1. `https://boards.greenhouse.io/embed/job_app?for={slug}&token={ext_id}`
         This is the iframe-embed endpoint — returns ONLY the application
         form HTML. Companies have no way to redirect this; it's the
         endpoint they embed in their own page.

      2. `https://boards.greenhouse.io/{slug}/jobs/{ext_id}/applications/new`
         The explicit form path. Most companies don't redirect this either,
         since redirecting it would break their own custom careers page.

    We try those two first. The canonical `/jobs/{id}` URLs go LAST since
    they're the ones most commonly redirected away.
