"""
Loop Service — multi-Loop layer on top of the existing agent infrastructure.

A Loop is one autonomous search the user kicked off with a natural-language
brief. Users can have multiple Loops running in parallel (subject to their
tier's max_loops cap). Each Loop runs cycles, drafts emails, and produces
its own SMS notification.

Data model:
    users/{uid}/loops/{loopId}
        id, name, briefText, briefParsed,
        reviewBeforeSend, weeklyTarget, smsEnabled,
        status (idle | running | paused | done),
        createdAt, lastRunAt, nextRunAt,
        totalContactsFound, totalEmailsDrafted, totalJobsFound, ...

Cycles/actions/jobs/companies stay at users/{uid}/agent_cycles, etc., but get
a loopId field so we can filter by Loop. Old documents without a loopId belong
to the "default" Loop created during migration.

This module is the source of truth for everything user-visible called a "Loop."
The legacy agent_service is now treated as plumbing — it knows how to execute
one cycle, but it doesn't decide which Loop the cycle belongs to.
